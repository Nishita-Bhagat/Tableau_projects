### DATA ANALYSIS USING SQL :
It's important to clean, filter and build the star schema in MySQL so that it can be hooked to tableau
We will plug mysql database with tableau. In tableau we will do data cleaning and ETL (Extract, transform , load). This process is also known as data munging or data wrangling.
We will do currency normalization, handling invalid values etc.

We have build tableau dashboard.
   1) Sheet vs dashboard
   2) Create label summarization of revenue, sales quantity
   3) Create bar charts for various measures
   4) Create year and month filter buttons for our dashboard
   5) Revenue trend chart
   6) Final dashboard where we will combine individual sheet
   7) Publish dashboard to tableau online
